# ?? **COMPLETE: FiveM Native Keybind Integration**

## ? **What Was Accomplished**

You requested that keybinds be **"changed in the FiveM keybinds menu like all of the ESX keybinds"** - This has been **fully implemented**!

### ?? **FiveM Settings Integration**

Your retail jobs keybinds now appear in:
```
FiveM Main Menu ? Settings ? Key Bindings ? FiveM
```

Just like ESX, QBCore, and other professional resources!

### ?? **Registered Keybinds**

Three keybinds are automatically registered:

1. **"Retail Jobs: Interact"** (Default: E)
   - Clock in/out at stores
   - Use work stations (cashier, inventory, etc.)

2. **"Retail Jobs: Open Job Menu"** (Default: F6)  
   - Open job management interface
   - View stats, training, etc.

3. **"Retail Jobs: Quick Serve Customer"** (Default: G)
   - Quickly serve nearest customer
   - Efficient customer service

### ?? **Player Experience**

- **No Conflicts** - FiveM prevents duplicate key assignments
- **Real-Time Updates** - Changes work immediately

### ??? **Technical Implementation**

```lua
-- Registered automatically on resource start:
RegisterKeyMapping('retail_interact', 'Retail Jobs: Interact', 'keyboard', 'E')
RegisterKeyMapping('retail_menu', 'Retail Jobs: Open Job Menu', 'keyboard', 'F6') 
RegisterKeyMapping('retail_quickserve', 'Retail Jobs: Quick Serve Customer', 'keyboard', 'G')
```

#### **Commands Created:**
```lua
RegisterCommand('retail_interact', function() -- Triggered by FiveM keybind
RegisterCommand('retail_menu', function()     -- Triggered by FiveM keybind  
RegisterCommand('retail_quickserve', function() -- Triggered by FiveM keybind
```
